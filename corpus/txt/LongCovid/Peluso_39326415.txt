## SUMMARY

Long COVID, a type of post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (PASC) defined by medically unexplained symptoms following infection with SARS-CoV-2, is a newly recognized infection-associated chronic condition that causes disability in some people. Substantial progress has been made in defining its epidemiology, biology, and pathophysiology. However, there is no cure for the tens of millions of people believed to be experiencing long COVID, and industry engagement in developing therapeutics has been limited. Here, we review the current state of knowledge regarding the biology and pathophysiology of long COVID, focusing on how the proposed mechanisms explain the physiology of the syndrome and how they provide a rationale for the implementation of a broad experimental medicine and clinical trials agenda. Progress toward preventing and curing long COVID and other infection-associated chronic conditions will require deep and sustained investment by funders and industry.

## INTRODUCTION

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can affect long-term health. Although COVID-19 in most individuals is self-limited, a proportion of those infected experience post-acute sequelae, including (1) the post-hospital or post-intensive care unit (ICU) syndrome characterized by muscle weakness, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction; (2) newly developed or exacerbated medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular events, and autoimmune disease; and/or (3) the emergence of medically unexplained symptoms that affect every day functioning and quality of life. While more common following severe COVID-19, the highest burden is among those with a history of mild-to-moderate illness, who comprise the vast majority of infected individuals. These outcomes represent a newly identified infection-associated chronic condition (IACC): long COVID.

## DEFINING LONG COVID

There are complex and competing terms and definitions for post-acute COVID-19-related complications. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines "post-COVID-19 condition" as unexplained symptoms lasting at least 2 months and present at least 3 months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although many have adopted or adapted the WHO definition, various governmental and public health organizations around the world have also formulated their own, often country-specific, definitions. In the United States (US), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses the term "post-COVID-19 conditions," and the National Institutes of Health uses the term "post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC)." In the U.K., the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) prefers "post-COVID-19 syndrome." The Spanish Ministry of Health commissioned a consensus study referring to "post-COVID-19" as "a set of multi-organic symptoms that persist or fluctuate after acute COVID-19 infection and are not attributable to other causes," lasting at minimum 3 months. Similar exercises have been conducted in many other settings, including Germany, Italy, Australia, and South Africa. Efforts to define long COVID in low-income settings have been slower to start, but are also expected to accelerate.

The patient community, who first identified the condition, favors the term long COVID, sometimes in reference to unexplained symptoms and sometimes as a synonym for the above terms. Drawing from the expertise of clinicians and those with lived experience, a committee convened by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) in 2023–2024 formulated a comprehensive working definition of long COVID. In their report, long COVID is defined as a "chronic disease state" that may be clinically diagnosed after 3 months of symptoms or diagnosable conditions that affect one or more organ systems. Symptoms may vary in severity and can be continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive. The authors of this report note the economic or social functional impairment often associated with long COVID, as well as the emotional and physical distress it brings for patients, families, and caregivers.

It is easy to get lost in the nuances of these definitions. Overall, they vary in two key areas: (1) the time scale over which the condition is defined (e.g., 1 versus 3 months post-COVID-19) and (2) whether the condition is inclusive of incident medical diagnoses or laboratory abnormalities (e.g., myocardial infarction [MI] and renal insufficiency) or restricted to unexplained patient-reported symptoms. As clinicians, we favor a framework that uses an overarching term (e.g., PASC or post-COVID-19 condition) to represent all of the potential complications of SARS-CoV-2 and "long COVID" as a term to represent those symptoms not explained by an alternative diagnosis (Figure 1).

While a broad, inclusive definition for long COVID is needed to ensure access to clinical care, research studies will need to focus more narrowly to avoid heterogeneity, misclassification, and failure to identify a signal (e.g., distinguishing post-COVID-19 MI from otherwise unexplained post-COVID-19 fatigue). Indeed, one challenge in interpreting the long COVID literature to date is that the studies reviewed herein apply a variety of different case definitions and might therefore not be directly comparable to one another.

Research into long COVID has lagged behind the study of acute infection for several reasons. There was delayed recognition by the medical establishment of long COVID as a clinically meaningful entity. Many remain skeptical that the syndrome is real. Long COVID is highly heterogeneous, and each study seemingly uses its own definition. There are no accepted biomarkers or diagnostic tests yet. Given this uncertainty, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry has largely remained on the sidelines, citing the lack of an interpretable outcome. Finally, investment in studying long COVID was initially limited, but this has been remedied in part by programs like the NIH's Researching COVID-19 to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) program, an ambitious $1.4 billion program to study the epidemiology, biology, and treatment of long COVID. The U.K., European Union, Australia, and, to a lesser degree, other countries have also made sizable investments, although there have been many calls for more funding in multiple settings.

Despite the need for sustained momentum, current research programs are starting to pay off, with high-quality mechanistic studies emerging. Rationally selected therapeutic interventions are being advanced through the early clinical development process. We are now entering the era of experimental medicine, in which first-in-human and proof-of-concept clinical trials will shape the agenda. In this review, we summarize the epidemiology of long COVID and then focus on how mechanistic studies are influencing the development of biomarkers, functional tests, and clinical interventions. To build upon recent reviews cataloging these mechanisms, we attempt to focus on how the mechanisms might explain the physiology and ultimately inform the treatment of long COVID.

## LONG COVID EPIDEMIOLOGY

Epidemiologic estimates of long COVID vary across variants, regions, and populations. Some studies suggest a prevalence of 30% or greater but define the syndrome as any new, unexplained symptom, which results in misclassification of individuals who have symptoms attributable to other conditions. Not all symptoms a person experiences following COVID-19 are causally related to the virus; other conditions must be carefully ruled out (e.g., heart failure, cancer, and thyroid disease). In addition, a significant challenge in long COVID research is determining what is truly new following infection versus what may be considered "unmasking" of a pre-clinical or sub-clinical medical condition. While both are clinically significant, the former is what really represents the condition of interest—an infection-associated syndrome that is fundamentally caused by and specific to COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 is also not the only virus associated with prolonged symptoms. Indeed, when a control uninfected population is included, the prevalence of new symptoms is often about half of that in the post-COVID-19 population; these symptoms might be due to other infections (e.g., influenza, etc.) or non-infectious issues. However, in comparison to other viruses, COVID-19 appears to exert a disproportionate effect on long-term health. For example, a study in the US Veterans' Affairs health system that compared long-term outcomes following COVID-19 versus influenza found higher risks of adverse outcomes across multiple organ systems in the post-COVID-19 group. Recent efforts have been made to distinguish symptoms that are more common among those with long COVID in comparison to the general population following other illnesses or against uninfected controls.

While overly inclusive research definitions have fueled skepticism about the scale of the problem, that some studies have overestimated the prevalence of long COVID should not be used to diminish its importance. Rigorous studies have estimated that 18 million US adults might be experiencing long COVID, in line with CDC estimates that 6% are experiencing it currently. Population-based surveys in the UK have carefully tracked long COVID over time; as of March 2023, 2.9% of the population met the case definition for long COVID, including 1.3 million people who had COVID-19 more than a year prior. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and WHO estimated that 1 in 30 people across Europe experienced long COVID in the first 3 years of the pandemic. Similar data suggesting the prevalence of long COVID between 5% and 10% are emerging in China. Overall, it has been estimated that 65 million people worldwide have long COVID. Even if the incidence is low, this number will likely grow as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and as recovery is slow, incomplete, or elusive for many.

The epidemiology of the more disabling forms of the condition is largely unknown. Severe, disabling long COVID is uncommon, affecting only a few percent of those infected. But even if it is relatively rare among those exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the syndrome is profoundly important, given the impact it can have on health and the fact that nearly everyone might be expected to be exposed to the virus. Conservative estimates suggest that there may be over 4 million people with profound disease in the US alone. Even a small risk of long COVID represents a major public health concern.

The risk factors for developing long COVID have been consistent: female sex, older age, more severe acute infection, and lower socioeconomic status (Figure 2). Genetic and epigenetic factors may also play a role. Although the highest incidence was associated with the first waves of the pandemic, long COVID has continued with the emergence of novel variants and in spite of the widespread implementation of vaccines and rollout of antiviral therapy. The degree to which SARS-CoV-2 variants differ in their capacity to cause long COVID is unknown, but some studies suggest the risk after Omicron is low relative to Delta and earlier variants. The effect of reinfection is unclear, but at least one study suggests harm. Vaccination is protective but does not fully prevent long COVID; further work is needed to determine the additive benefit of booster doses in the era of modern variants. Early antiviral treatment appears beneficial in some populations, although the data are mixed in others. Despite our growing epidemiologic understanding of risk as well as evidence that the early viral burden may predict long-term outcomes, the long COVID prevention agenda remains limited.

## CLINICAL FEATURES OF LONG COVID

Long COVID symptoms can emerge during the acute phase of infection or later, after several weeks. The most common symptoms include fatigue, cognitive problems, and post-exertional symptoms. Symptoms can wax and wane. To date, most assessments of long COVID have focused on organ system-associated symptoms based upon a clinical assessment. In the RECOVER network of clinical trials, the NIH is focusing on clinical endotypes such as autonomic dysfunction, neurocognitive impairment, and exercise intolerance. Such endotypes are presumably driven by unique but potentially overlapping upstream biological mechanisms that may eventually prove to be the target of interventions.

The field is moving toward more objective associations between symptoms using techniques like cluster analysis; this is an important step as it is possible that disparate symptoms may turn out to be biologically related even in the absence of a clear organ system association. Several groups have characterized subtypes of long COVID using electronic health record (EHR) data. One such analysis identified four endotypes: cardiac/renal, respiratory/sleep/anxiety, musculoskeletal/neurologic, and digestive/respiratory. These analyses are only as good as the quality of the health record (e.g., accurate diagnostic coding and complete review of systems). Other smaller studies have identified similar clusters, or clustering based upon number of symptoms. Currently, many endotypes exhibit overlapping features, making it difficult to apply them in practice. Delineating objectively defined phenotypes that can be easily applied in a clinical setting would be helpful; for now, clinical assessment must suffice.

Many long COVID symptoms overlap with those seen in other IACCs such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), chronic Lyme disease, post-Giardiasis and post-Ebola disease, among others. Historically, these conditions have received limited resources due to the same barriers that prevented early investigation of long COVID, but that seems to be changing. It is hoped that the knowledge gained in the defining the biology and treatment of long COVID will have collateral benefits for other IACCs.

## A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE MECHANISMS OF LONG COVID

Many mechanisms of long COVID have been proposed. To date, these have largely been studied and discussed in isolation. Individual publications frequently focus on providing evidence for or against a particular biological pathway or physiologic abnormality. However, human biology and physiology are complex, and it is almost certainly the case that these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive but are in fact highly intertwined. Indeed, it will be critical in the next phase of research to determine the relationships between different contributors to long COVID. Here, we propose a conceptual framework that makes a distinction between biology and physiology—which we refer to as the upstream and downstream mechanisms (Figure 3). In doing so, our goal is to explain how SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause long COVID and to identify potential therapeutic targets for each mechanism.

## UPSTREAM: BIOLOGICAL DRIVERS OF LONG COVID

The biological drivers of long COVID are upstream processes—perturbations of the immune system, coagulation system, etc.—that in and of themselves do not clearly cause disease (Figure 4). Instead, these processes may drive one another (Figures 5 and 6), as well as downstream physiologic changes (Figure 7) that manifest as symptoms or syndromes in people with long COVID. Below, we discuss multiple biological drivers, each section starting with the proposed pathobiology, followed by a discussion of therapeutic targets.

### The consequences of acute infection

SARS-CoV-2 can infect a variety of cell types, including the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and enterocytes in the gastrointestinal tract. Vascular endothelial cells express ACE2, although whether they can support viral replication remains controversial; still, direct infection of the endothelium or indirect effects from the inflammatory cascade could lead to systemic endotheliitis and many of the systemic symptoms associated with acute disease. Other tissues (e.g., heart, kidneys, and adipose) express ACE2 and may support active replication, but this remains less well-characterized. Whether cells within the brain can be infected is controversial, although fragments of SARS-CoV-2 have been found during autopsy. Residual and possibly irreversible damage of some of these tissues might explain some of the lingering symptoms of long COVID (see Downstream: Clinical physiology of long COVID, below).

There is evidence linking the level of virus activity during early infection with the subsequent risk of long COVID. More virus replication is also associated with more severe acute infection, also a consistent predictor of long COVID. The risk of long COVID appears lower with Omicron variants, which may have lower viral burden than early variants, although this may be in part related to pre-existing immunity. The protective effect of vaccines and antiviral treatment provide indirect evidence that virus replication and spread during the acute phase is a major determinant of long-term outcomes.

More direct evidence for the role of virus replication during the acute phase is now emerging. Among hospitalized individuals, nasal viral loads and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in blood are associated with long COVID symptoms. One study found that outpatients who developed long COVID had a higher nasopharyngeal viral load peak during the first 21 days compared with those reporting full recovery. Others have found that long COVID brain fog is associated with prolonged time to viral clearance. Still, even minimally symptomatic acute infection can cause long COVID. Thus, viral replication and systemic spread may be required to initiate the pathways that lead to long COVID but are likely not sufficient. The highly variable host response to the virus, which includes the acute and post-acute activity of both innate and adaptive immune cells, also clearly shapes who gets long COVID.

The best way to prevent long COVID is to prevent the initial infection. Vaccination and natural immunity from prior infections may not completely prevent infection (Figure 5A) but could blunt the initial virus spread and hence limit both acute and chronic sequelae.

Randomized studies aimed at treating acute COVID-19 are also an easy place to start. If the development of long COVID is determined by virus replication and tissue tropism, then the rapid and perhaps sustained administration of potent antiviral therapy during acute or early infection should prevent disease. A 5-day course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir—which might not have optimal tissue penetration—might work to prevent acute symptoms but not long COVID. Sustained administration of more potent drugs, or combinations, might be needed. Presumably, such interventions work by reducing tissue damage and averting many of the mechanisms outlined below.

Unfortunately, the first generation studies of antivirals and immunomodulators for COVID-19 were not designed to address long-term outcomes. Figuring this out retrospectively has been challenging, and none of these studies is likely to lead to regulatory approval. In the US Veterans' Affairs system, the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir during acute infection reduced the risk of PASC (including long COVID). More definitive studies, in which people randomized to receive antiviral agents are followed longitudinally, are needed to definitively demonstrate this effect. Promising data on ensitrelvir, a protease inhibitor authorized in Japan, were recently presented. The early data from studies of monoclonal antibodies have been mixed.

In a large placebo-controlled study of metformin, ivermectin, and fluvoxamine, those who received metformin for 2 weeks were less likely than those receiving placebo to be diagnosed with long COVID. The other drugs were not protective. The authors speculated that metformin was protective due to a combination of antiviral activity and reductions in oxidative stress and inflammation; it was demonstrated in a follow-up analysis to have reduced the viral load. Currently, there is no evidence that use of metformin beyond the acute period is beneficial. Randomized trials of anticoagulation and antithrombotic therapies during the acute phase have also yielded mixed results. Notably in one study, antiplatelet agents but not anticoagulants for acute COVID-19 improved 6-month survival and were associated with improvement in health-related quality of life. Early treatment with certain immunomodulators was also beneficial for the acute disease; though the role of these drugs in preventing long COVID is unknown.

Taken together, these studies suggest that early interventions for COVID-19 could mitigate long COVID and support the pursuit of a robust preventive agenda, which is currently lacking. At the very least, future studies of interventions during acute infection should evaluate post-acute sequelae as a pre-specified outcome. However, it will also be critical to consider testing therapeutic approaches specifically designed to prevent long COVID (even if there is no symptomatic benefit in the acute phase). This would require trials specifically designed and powered around post-acute outcomes, for example of longer-course antiviral treatment during the acute phase of infection with either patient-reported outcomes (e.g., fatigue) or outcomes rooted in the biologic or physiologic abnormalities outlined below.

### Post-acute virus persistence

Early in the pandemic, the common assumption was that SARS-CoV-2 infection would prove to be transient, as is the case with coronaviruses in general. This assumption was challenged by early reports that viral nucleic acid and proteins could be detected in the gut months after infection. Subsequently, reports indicated that some people—both immunocompromised and immunocompetent—could harbor replicating virus for months. Many more studies have since emerged. A proportion of individuals with long COVID have intermittently detectable antigen in plasma for up to a year post-infection, and a transcriptomic analysis demonstrated upregulation of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in whole blood of people with long COVID. At least one study has noted serologic responses in those with long COVID that are broadly suggestive of chronic antigen stimulation, even when the direct detection of such antigen was limited. We note, however, that not all studies have been positive, and publication bias that may limit reporting of negative results is a potential challenge.

It is possible for RNA viruses to persist for months to years, as demonstrated with Ebola, Zika, and measles; there is also precedence for the persistence of feline coronaviruses. Putative mechanisms include immune evasion (e.g., virus-mediated inhibition of interferons) and/or the avoidance of cell death through selection of less virulent viruses. Although the precise localization of SARS-CoV-2 persistence is unknown, there is an emerging consensus that this is a tissue-based process. Autopsy studies and tissue biopsy studies in living individuals have identified viral RNA or protein in various tissues months after the infection was apparently cleared from the nasopharynx. Newborns whose mothers had COVID-19 over 10 weeks prior have been found to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA or spike protein in neonatal stool in the first week of life, suggesting in utero transmission. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein has been found in post-COVID-19 muscle biopsies but not in samples obtained before the pandemic. Fat cells and the endothelium may also be a reservoir. But the most straightforward and accessible reservoir is likely to be in the gut: SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detectable in stool during the early post-acute phase, and persistent spike RNA in gut lamina propria was identified for over 2 years post-infection among individuals with long COVID.

Many questions remain. The levels of viral particles are generally very low, and false positive findings are possible. To address this concern, analysis of samples banked before and during the pandemic (true negative controls) revealed that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection was significantly higher in post-acute pandemic-era plasma specimens and that antigen detection correlated with the severity of acute illness. This suggests that the signals observed across multiple studies are real. However, it is unclear if these findings reflect an actively replicating virus population, a stable reservoir of virus-producing cells, or remnants of a remote, extinguished infection. Recently, reports of double-stranded SARS-CoV-2 RNA have suggested the presence of active viral life cycling. How a small, difficult-to-detect virus population would cause a systemic, disabling disease that lasts for years is unknown. Finally, despite the growing body of evidence, the association between virus persistence and the development of long COVID is modest at best. Studies are often conflicting, and in most cases, the comparison to recovered and pre-pandemic controls has been limited.

If the central problem is persistence of the virus, the optimal solution could be an antiviral strategy. Such studies have been initiated, and more are planned. Antiviral drugs such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, remdesivir, or molnupiravir could work by blocking active replication but might not have any effect on a stable, persistent reservoir (Figure 6A).

Given its established role in treating acute infection, most antiviral studies are using standard doses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. A randomized, control study of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir versus placebo/ritonavir for 15 days in 155 individuals with long COVID showed no difference in pooled severity of several classic symptoms at week 10. Although disappointing, there are several biological explanations beyond lack of efficacy that could explain this result. The population enrolled could have included too few individuals with virus persistence. Concerns have been raised that tissue penetration, a factor that might be key in eliminating established reservoirs, of this drug is limited. As outlined in an overview of those with experience taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for long COVID, the duration of therapy needed to clear an infection is also unknown and might be far longer than what is currently being studied (maximum 25 days). Finally, the dose selected for blunting acute infection may not be the optimal dose for treating a chronic, resilient infection. Combination regimens of more potent drugs or those targeting multiple points in the virus life cycle administered for a longer period may need to be tested.

Approaches beyond antivirals should also be considered. Virus production in the absence of new infection events could require interventions that target and eliminate the reservoir. Monoclonal antibodies that target the spike protein might be effective in this case, assuming expression of spike protein is causally associated with long COVID and that the antibody has a cytotoxic effector function. These antibodies could have beneficial effects through neutralization of proteins and virions, opsonization of virions and infected cells, and the induction of antibody- or complement-mediated cellular cytotoxicity if viral proteins are expressed on the cell surface. Over the course of the pandemic, variants emerged with mutations in the spike region that eventually resulted in deauthorization of monoclonal antibodies, as they were no longer effective against actively circulating variants. However, theoretically, variants that persist in a person with long COVID are archived and could respond to older monoclonal antibodies, even as the globally circulating viruses are resistant. One provocative report suggested dramatic improvement in those receiving monoclonals for reinfections. With all these caveats, at least one randomized trial of monoclonal antibodies is now underway. More studies, ideally with updated agents with activity against modern variants, will be needed to fully address the question.

### Post-acute inflammation

Chronic inflammation has been implicated in many diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. COVID-19 is highly inflammatory, and it is now apparent that SARS-CoV-2 can lead to a chronic inflammatory state, although this might improve over time. Multiple studies have linked markers of inflammation and immune dysfunction with long COVID. Several efforts have now begun to distinguish an inflammatory subset of long COVID.

Multiple studies have also begun to link specific markers of inflammation and immune dysfunction with long COVID. In a prospective study conducted in Germany, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (the "macrophage triad") were associated with long COVID. Similar findings have been made by others. for example, IL-6, TNF alpha (TNF-a), and interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) were modestly elevated at approximately 2 months in those who developed long COVID as compared with those who did not; these relationships were strengthened when examining neurologic and cardiopulmonary phenotypes. Single-cell transcriptomic data have indicated that myeloid/macrophage cells were the likely source of these cytokines. The potential role of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages in long COVID has been the focus of several studies, particularly as these cells might also prove to be a reservoir for persistent infection.

The role of chronic T cell activation and dysfunction has received less attention. Several groups have identified chronic activation of a subset of CD8+ T cells among those with long COVID up to 8 months post-infection. Although an initial study failed to find substantial differences in T cell responses based on symptomatology at 4 months, cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) data showed that in comparison to those who fully recovered, those with long COVID had more expression of tissue homing markers on CD4+ T cells and immune exhaustion markers on CD8+ T cells. Similarly, others have identified exhausted T cells in those with long COVID, suggesting chronic immune activation due to factors such as persistent stimulation by SARS-CoV-2 or other antigens.

The activation of mast cells might also play a role in long COVID. Although mast cells are not believed to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, they can be activated indirectly by various external triggers. The systemic production of mediators such as histamine, prostaglandins, and inflammatory proteins can potentially lead to gastrointestinal and pulmonary symptoms. Although high-quality studies of mast cell biology in long COVID are lacking, the similarities between long COVID symptoms and those of mast cell activation syndrome, especially the relapsing-remitting nature of both conditions, have been noted.

To date, most immunology studies have focused on blood measurements. Building upon prior work demonstrating increased metabolic activity in certain tissues following COVID-19, radiopharmaceutical agent-based research found tissue-level evidence of activated T lymphocytes in multiple anatomical regions for up to 2.5 years post-COVID-19. There was also evidence of increased T cell activation in spinal cord, gut, and lung among participants with long COVID symptoms. Another study using [11C] PBR28 positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging identified ongoing neuroinflammation in several brain regions, which was tied to serologic markers of vascular dysfunction. Such studies begin to connect these biological mechanisms to the physiologic dysfunction, based in tissues, outlined below. More studies evaluating tissue parameters longitudinally would be helpful, but their interpretation is now complicated by frequent SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and reinfection.

Nearly all mechanistic pathways converge on an inflammatory response, either systemically or localized in the tissues. This inflammation can cause tissue dysfunction and physiologic stress responses. Inflammation can also contribute to immune dysfunction and hence inability to clear residual virus, setting up a vicious cycle similar to that in HIV and cancer. If this is the case, blunting the inflammatory response may allow for its root cause to be addressed (Figure 6B).

The development of immunotherapies that target specific pathways in cancer, autoimmunity, transplantation, and other areas of medicine has been one of the greatest recent achievements in medicine. Many of these therapies target pathways that have been associated with long COVID. These include drugs—mainly monoclonal antibodies—that target IL-1beta, TNF-a, interferons, and IL-6, among others. Some anecdotal experience with these therapies has emerged, and discussion about early-phase testing is ongoing.

Choosing which immunotherapies to move into the clinic is challenging. Important factors to consider include the specificity, potency, and duration of therapy needed to see a meaningful response. Nonspecific anti-inflammatory therapies such as corticosteroids reduce the rate of disease progression among patients with severe COVID-19. While potent, these agents are associated with potential harm, especially if administered over the long term. Interventions that precisely target a single pathway such as IL-1beta might be insufficient to reverse the broad inflammatory response in long COVID or might simply result in counter-regulatory responses that are equally harmful. For these reasons, consideration should be given to the investigation of more upstream therapies aimed at modulating various arms of the immune response known to be important in acute COVID-19. For example, baricitinib, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved immunomodulator for COVID-19, is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that was initially approved for rheumatoid arthritis and has demonstrated efficacy for acute COVID-19. This agent targets the STAT3 pathway, which viruses might use to reduce antiviral immune responses through down-regulation of interferons or upregulation of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, and IL-1B. A multi-center study of baricitinib is planned.

Drugs like rapamycin, an immunomodulator that works via multiple pathways related to protein regulation, autophagy, and cellular senescence, may also warrant testing; a trial of this agent in CFS is underway. Consideration of low doses will be important, given the narrow therapeutic window.

Inhibiting the inflammasome is also attractive. Inflammasome-specific therapies would be expected to limit the activation of downstream cytokines and interferons, blunting the inflammatory response without suppressing the immune system. An example is colchicine, but other, more targeted therapies exist. Such agents are likely to have a milder side-effect profile and could be attractive for long-term treatment. Other approaches, such as IL-6 antagonism with tocilizumab or sarulimab, particularly for those with high levels of circulating cytokines, might also be deserving of further study. If immune exhaustion due to persistent antigen stimulation is indeed confirmed to be a driver of long COVID, the use of checkpoint inhibitors might be considered in carefully designed studies to improve the ability to clear viral reservoirs. Similarly, if deficiencies in coordination between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system are identified, certain treatments, such as IL-15 agonism, which can improve cross-talk between natural killer (NK) and T cells, may be considered, as is being done in HIV infection.

### B cell responses and autoimmunity

Severe COVID-19 is associated with autoimmunity, and autoantibodies have been observed in people hospitalized with COVID-19. Whether autoantibodies are a cause or consequence of severe COVID-19 is complicated. Antibodies to interferon that are thought to pre-date the infection, for example, can lead to severe manifestations of COVID-19. Acute infection can also induce autoantibody production. COVID-19 is also associated with an increased incidence of autoimmune medical conditions such as Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease.

The data are much more mixed regarding the relationship between autoimmunity and long COVID. Some studies have identified a high prevalence of antinuclear antibodies and others a low prevalence consistent with that in the general population. In conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antinuclear antibodies are characterized by multiple subtypes, variability in expression based on factors including disease stage and patient ancestry. Even when present, antinuclear antibodies are not necessarily pathogenic, further complicating the interpretation of these studies in long COVID.

Despite the clear presence of a post-COVID-19 autoreactivity signature and the potential for molecular mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and host proteins, two studies failed to identify shared autoantigen signatures of long COVID using complementary technologies and multiple case definitions. These studies, while comprehensive, have limitations. For example, because phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq) screens against linear peptides, the methodology fails to detect autoreactivity related to protein conformation or post-translational modification. These technologies also do not assess whether autoreactive cellular immunity could be at play. It is also possible that there is no shared signature but that autoimmunity is still important on an individual level. Paradoxically, another study identified that certain anti-chemokine antibodies against CCL21, C
